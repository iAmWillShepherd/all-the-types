# Typescript Declaration Files

TypeScript declaration files are used to declare the types of variables, functions, classes, etc. in a TypeScript program. In order to write TypeScript declaration files, you must first understand the basic types of TypeScript. As such, this workshop will start with a primer on the type system before getting into the details of writing declaration files.

## Basic Types

### String

Strings in TypeScript enable you to represent textual data. You can use single quotes or double quotes to create strings.

###### Single quote strings

`const str = 'Single quote string'`

###### Double quote strings

`const str = "Double quote string"`

A CLI for all-the-types.
